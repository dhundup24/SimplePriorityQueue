# SimplePriorityQueue
SimplePriorityQueue is a data structure I created that allows users to insert, delete, ask if the SPQ contains a certain element, etc. This data structure takes advantage of a sorted list, so run time complexity for all of these features be in logarithmic or constant time, which can be faster than other data structures such as an ArrayList.
